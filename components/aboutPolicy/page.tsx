          While essentially situating ourselves as an intermediary (In the words
          of the eminent political economist Mushtaq Khan) between the state and
          the people, we will help shape international aid and public finance in
          the best interest of people, political governments and donors ensuring
          value of money, transparency and implementing development solutions
          based on global research but contextualizing it in local political,
          social and institutional contexts.
        </p>
        <p>
          A big part of our work will be around developing policy capability in
          political parties and parliamentary structures to help them manage
          policy at local, provincial and federal level specially in our core
          areas of interest and hence playing our critical role in harnessing
          and deepening our democracy and help build peopleâ€™s faith in it.
