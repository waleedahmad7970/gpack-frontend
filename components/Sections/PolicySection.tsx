                        While essentially situating ourselves as an intermediary (In the words
                        of the eminent political economist Mushtaq Khan) between the state and
                        the people, we will help shape international aid and public finance in
                        the best interest of people, political governments and donors ensuring
                        value of money, transparency and implementing development solutions
                        based on global research but contextualizing it in local political,
                        social and institutional contexts.

                        A big part of our work will be around developing policy capability in
                        political parties and parliamentary structures to help them manage
                        policy at local, provincial and federal level specially in our core
                        areas of interest and hence playing our critical role in harnessing
                        and deepening our democracy and help build peopleâ€™s faith in it.
